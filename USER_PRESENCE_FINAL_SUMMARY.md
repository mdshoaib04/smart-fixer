# User Presence Tracking Implementation - Final Summary

## Overview
This document summarizes the successful implementation of real-time user presence tracking in the SmartFixer application.

## Issues Resolved
1. **Database Schema**: Added required `last_active`, `last_seen`, and `is_online` columns to the users table
2. **Routes.py File**: Fixed syntax errors and duplicate route definitions in the complex routes.py file
3. **Application Startup**: Resolved compilation errors that were preventing the application from starting

## Features Implemented

### 1. Database Schema Updates
- ✅ Added `last_active` column to track user activity timestamps
- ✅ Added `last_seen` column for backward compatibility
- ✅ Added `is_online` column to track user online status

### 2. Backend Functionality
- ✅ **Presence Tracking Functions**: Helper functions to update and retrieve user presence status
- ✅ **Socket.IO Integration**: Real-time updates using WebSocket connections
- ✅ **API Endpoint**: RESTful endpoint to fetch user presence status
- ✅ **Activity Detection**: Automatic detection of user activities (connection, disconnection, user actions)

### 3. Presence Status Logic
- ✅ **🟢 Online**: User is currently active in the app (within 5-minute grace period)
- ✅ **🕐 Active X minutes ago**: User was recently active (within 5 minutes but not currently connected)
- ✅ **⏰ Last seen at [time]**: User was last active more than 5 minutes ago

### 4. Time Formatting
- ✅ Less than 1 hour → "Last seen X minutes ago"
- ✅ Same day → "Last seen today at HH:MM"
- ✅ Yesterday → "Last seen yesterday at HH:MM"
- ✅ Otherwise → "Last seen on DD/MM/YYYY at HH:MM"

## Technical Implementation

### Database Migration
The database schema was successfully updated to include the necessary columns:
- `last_active` (DATETIME): Tracks the last activity timestamp
- `last_seen` (DATETIME): Maintains backward compatibility
- `is_online` (BOOLEAN): Tracks real-time online status

### Backend Functions
Key functions implemented in the routes:

1. `update_user_presence(user_id)`: Updates user's last active timestamp and online status
2. `get_user_presence_status(user_id)`: Calculates and formats user presence status
3. Socket.IO event handlers for real-time updates:
   - `handle_user_activity()`: Handles user activity events
   - `handle_connect_presence()`: Updates status when user connects
   - `handle_disconnect_presence()`: Updates status when user disconnects

### API Endpoint
- `GET /api/user-presence/<user_id>`: Returns formatted presence status for a user

## Verification
- ✅ Database schema correctly updated with all required columns
- ✅ Presence status calculation logic working correctly
- ✅ Real-time updates via Socket.IO functioning
- ✅ API endpoint returning correct presence information
- ✅ Application starts successfully without syntax errors

## Application Status
The SmartFixer application is now running successfully with the presence tracking functionality implemented:
- Accessible at http://localhost:5002
- Accessible at http://127.0.0.1:5002
- Accessible on local network at http://10.244.166.143:5002

## Future Improvements
- Add frontend UI components to display presence indicators
- Implement more sophisticated activity detection mechanisms
- Add presence status to user profile pages
- Enhance the presence tracking with more detailed status information
