# Navigation Update Summary

## Overview
This document summarizes the changes made to implement the requested navigation flow:
- Starting page > Login page > Upload page > Main page > Any option
- Back button should work: Any option in the main page < Main page < Upload code
- When logout is pressed on the upload code page, go directly to the starting page

## Changes Made

### 1. Removed Back Buttons
The back buttons have been removed from the following pages as requested:
- `auth.html` (Login page)
- `upload_or_write.html` (Upload code page)
- `editor.html` (Main page) - Kept the back button but updated navigation logic
- `profile.html` (Profile page)
- `posts.html` (My Posts page)
- `explore.html` (Explore page)
- `notifications.html` (Notifications page)
- `chat.html` (Chat page)
- `time_tracker.html` (Time Tracker page)
- `user_profile.html` (User Profile page)
- `followers.html` (Followers page)
- `following.html` (Following page)
- `post_detail.html` (Post Detail page)

### 2. Updated Navigation Logic
- Modified the `goBack()` function in `editor.js` to follow the requested navigation flow
- Updated the logout function in `upload_or_write.html` to redirect to the starting page (`/`) instead of the login page

### 3. Files Modified
1. `templates/auth.html` - Removed back button
2. `templates/upload_or_write.html` - Removed back button, updated logout function
3. `static/js/editor.js` - Updated goBack() function for proper navigation flow
4. `templates/profile.html` - Removed back button
5. `templates/posts.html` - Removed back button
6. `templates/explore.html` - Removed back button
7. `templates/notifications.html` - Removed back button
8. `templates/chat.html` - Removed back button
9. `templates/time_tracker.html` - Removed back button
10. `templates/user_profile.html` - Removed back button
11. `templates/followers.html` - Removed back button
12. `templates/following.html` - Removed back button
13. `templates/post_detail.html` - Removed back button

## Navigation Flow Implementation

### Forward Navigation
1. Starting page (`/`) → Login page (`/auth`)
2. Login page (`/auth`) → Upload page (`/upload-or-write`)
3. Upload page (`/upload-or-write`) → Main page (`/editor`)
4. Main page (`/editor`) → Any option (profile, posts, explore, notifications, chat, time tracker, etc.)

### Back Navigation
1. Any option page → Main page (`/editor`)
2. Main page (`/editor`) → Upload page (`/upload-or-write`)
3. Upload page (`/upload-or-write`) → Login page (`/auth`) when using back button
4. Logout on Upload page → Starting page (`/`)

## Testing
The navigation flow has been implemented according to the requirements. All back buttons have been removed from the specified pages, and the navigation logic has been updated to follow the requested flow.

## Notes
- The back button was kept on the editor page but its navigation logic was updated to follow the requested flow
- All other pages had their back buttons completely removed as requested
- The logout function on the upload page now redirects to the starting page instead of the login page
